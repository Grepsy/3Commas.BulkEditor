## Prerequisites

- Windows 10
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 (which already might be installed on your Windows machine)
- 3Commas API key and secret

**Note:** By default, API keys are not stored on your computer and must be entered again the next time the application is started. There is an option to persist ApiKey and Secret. However, use is at your own risk. Other programs could read this information.

## Installer

I use MS ClickOnce for installation and updates.

An installer with the current version is hosted [here](https://marcdrexler.blob.core.windows.net/bulkeditor/BulkEditor.application)

Updates are automatically checked for each start.

Because the package is not signed with a public certificate, you might see some security warnings when installing and starting the app.

## Support

I develop and maintain this package on my own for free in my spare time.
Donations are greatly appreciated and a motivation to keep improving.
